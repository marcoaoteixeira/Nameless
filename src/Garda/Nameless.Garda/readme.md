# Nameless Garda

A simple package with guard clauses.
A [guard clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(computer_science)) is a
software pattern that simplifies complex functions by "failing fast", checking
for invalid inputs up front and immediately failing if any are found.
And if you thought about the [Gárda Síochána](https://www.garda.ie/ga/), the
national police service of Ireland, you're totally right!
