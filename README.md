# Nameless

This repository contains all code that I assume is useful in most of the cases
where I need to build something. So, if you think that it could be useful for
you, feel free to fork, clone, etc. Also, I tried to mention every person that
I got something from. If you find code that needs to be given the correct
authorship, please, let me know.

## Starting

Instructions below will show your the way to get things working.

### Pre-requirements

```
No pre-requirements
```

### Installing

```
Well, no need to install anything.
```

### Testing

There are some test projects. Maybe you'll need to install the coverage tool
and a report tool. If I'm not mistaken, Visual Studio already has those
dependencies installed for you after restore. But...

_.NET Coverlet Tool_

```
dotnet tool install -g coverlet.console
```

_.NET Report Generator Tool_

```
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
```

### Coding Styles

.github folder.

## Contribuition
